Prompt Forge Product Requirements Document
Overview
This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the development specifications for Prompt Forge, a prompt-debugging tool designed to facilitate simultaneous testing and comparison of prompts across multiple Large Language Models (LLMs). The document serves as a comprehensive guide for the development team, stakeholders, and quality assurance to ensure successful delivery of a tool that streamlines LLM prompt optimization workflows.
1. Introduction
Prompt engineering has become a critical skill in the age of Large Language Models, yet testing prompts across multiple providers remains a fragmented and time-consuming process. Prompt Forge addresses this challenge by providing a unified platform for simultaneous prompt testing, enabling developers, researchers, and AI practitioners to efficiently compare responses from various LLM providers including OpenAI, Claude, Google Gemini, and Ollama.
This document establishes the product requirements for building a client-side web application that prioritizes performance, accessibility, and user experience while maintaining complete data privacy through local-only storage.
